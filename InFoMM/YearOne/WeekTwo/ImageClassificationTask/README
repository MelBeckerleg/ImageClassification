# Image Classification 

Working with MNIST image files for handwritten digits (available from: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), exploring different methods for classifying test images, with both a training set and using the kmeans algorithm. 

This set of files includes:

Start here: folder containing MNIST data Database files and StartHere file for how to open in Matlab

Intensity.m :  classifies <m> test images by comparison with <p> training data files using the knn algorithm with k nearest neighbours.

Intensityerror.m : finds the error of classification using the intensity method for <m> images.

Intensityerrormetric.m - explores the use of different metrics, returning the error from testing m images 

pcaerror.m : returns the error when Principal Component Analysis is used to select the <k> feature vectors corresponding to the <k>th largest eignvalues of <m> test images.

kmeanserror.m : returns the error when the kmeans algorithm is applied to classify <m> images without use of training data

Terms:

Training Data images: used as a reference to classify test data images.

Training data labels: record the digit that corresponds to each image in the training data 

Test Data: images to be identified, by comparison with the training data.

Test data labels: record the digit that corresponds to each image in the test data (used for identifying error).

Intensity : matrix containing all the original pixel data in its original form.

Key Words: Knn-search, PCA, Kmeans, Image Classification, clustering.
