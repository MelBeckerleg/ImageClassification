Image Classification 

Working with MNIST image files for handwritten digits 
(available from: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), 
exploring different methods for classifying test images, 
with both a training set and using the kmeans algorithm. 

Key Words: Knn-search, PCA, Kmeans, Image Classification, Clustering.

This set of files includes:

    Starthere.m : 

folder containing MNIST data Database files and 
StartHere file for how to open in Matlab

    Intensity.m :  

classifies <n> test images by comparison with <p> training data files 
using the knn algorithm with k nearest neighbours.

    Intensityerror.m : 

finds the error of classification using the intensity method 
for <n> images, <p> files, <k> nearest neighbours.

    Intensityerrormetric.m - 

explores the use of different metrics, 
returning the error from testing m images 
against p training images, k neighbours.

    pcaerror.m : 

returns the error when Principal Component Analysis is used to 
select the <k> feature vectors corresponding to the <k>th largest 
eignvalues of <m> test images.

    kmeanserror.m : 

returns the error when the kmeans algorithm is applied 
to classify <m> images without use of training data.


Terms:

Training Data images: used as a reference to classify test data images.

Training data labels: the digits correspondsing to each training image.

Test Data: images to be identified, by comparison with the training data.

Test data labels: record the digit that corresponds to each test image
                     (used for identifying error).

Intensity : matrix containing all the original pixel data, 
            (ie without pca)
