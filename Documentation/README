Image Classification 

Working with MNIST image files for handwritten digits (available from: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), exploring different methods for classifying test images, with both a training set and using the kmeans algorithm. 

This set of files includes:

-Openimages: follder containing MNIST data Database files and StartHere file for how to open in Matlab

-Intensity.m : classifies <m> test images by comparison with the test data, using different norms with the knn algorithm

-Intensityerror.m : finds the error of classification using the intensity method for <m> images.

-pca.m : returns the error when Principal Component Analysis is used to select the <k> feature vectors corresponding to the <k>th largest eignvalues of <m> test images.

-kmeanserror.m : returns the error when the kmeans algorithm is applied to classify <m> images without use of training data

Key Terms:

Training Data images: used as a reference to classify test data images.

Training data labels: record the digit that corresponds to each image in the training data 

Test Data: images to be identified, by comparison with the training data.

Test data labels: record the digit that corresponds to each image in the test data (used for identifying error).

Intensity : matrix containing all the original pixel data in its original form.
